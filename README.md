**Bullet Points**

- I didn't use fl_charts package ever until saw this project. I firstly tested it. I tried to understand how it works.
- I wrote API for getting to data from URL.
- I created a class what its name is spots.dart, and I add in map values what I need.
- I imported provider package. I took map's items and add them in a list.
- I changed Stateful Widgets to Stateless Widgets. I implemented provider.
- I used the list to run fl_chart and created buttons for displaying to periods.
